# City Building

To build the app in its entirety, run npm build.

To build individual components, run 'npm run-script build-server', 'npm run-script build-vr', or 'npm run-script build-ui'

To start the server normally, run 'npm start'. To start for dev purposes, with a port of 3000, run 'npm run-script dev-start'.

The dev version of the app runs at localhost:3000/builder.html.
The vr view of the app runs at localhost:3000/vr.html.
